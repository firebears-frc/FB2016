/**
 * The Cheval de Frise is a series of four (4) independently tilting, weighted polycarbonate platforms. 
 * The platforms rotate about a pipe in the middle and are weighted so that they rest on alternate 
 * sides. Platforms are 1 ft. wide and 2 ft. long and Â½ in. thick. The axis of the pipe is 3-3/4 in. from 
 * the surface of the platform. The top edge of the platform is 9-5/8 in. from the DEFENSE platform. 
 * In order to tilt a platform, approximately 1 lbs. of force must be applied at the edge of the platform.

/**
 * The Drawbridge is an arched gateway with a door that lowers toward the NEUTRAL ZONE. The 
 * door is made from polycarbonate and is 37 in. tall and Â¼ in. thick. When the door is fully down, 
 * the opening is 3 ft. 6 in. wide and 5 ft. 5-3/4 in. tall (to the top of the center of the arch). The door 
 * is sprung so that it will return to a closed position when there is no weight on it. The door can be 
 * manipulated at any point, but for reference, it takes approximately 2 lbs. of force applied at the top 
 * edge of the door for it to begin to move. Once moving, the required force increases to a maximum of 5 lbs
